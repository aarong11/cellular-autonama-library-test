# Design Decisions

This document outlines the key design decisions made during the development of the Cellular Automata project.

## 1. Adapter Pattern

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - To abstract image processing operations, allowing flexibility in choosing different image processing libraries.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easy to extend with new adapters.
  - Promotes separation of concerns.
  
## 2. Singleton Pattern for `CellManager`

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Ensures a single point of management for all cell instances.
- **Benefits:**
  - Prevents duplication of manager instances.
  - Centralizes cell management logic.

## 3. TypeScript for Type Safety

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Provides static typing to catch errors during development.
- **Benefits:**
  - Improved code maintainability.
  - Enhanced developer experience with better tooling support.

## 4. Use of Jimp Library

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Jimp offers a straightforward API for image manipulation in Node.js.
- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies image processing tasks.
  - Wide community support.

## 5. Testing with Jest

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Jest is a robust testing framework suitable for TypeScript projects.
- **Benefits:**
  - Easy to write and maintain tests.
  - Provides useful features like mocking and snapshot testing.

## 6. Modular Project Structure

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Organizing code into clear modules enhances readability and scalability.
- **Benefits:**
  - Facilitates easier navigation and maintenance.
  - Simplifies the addition of new features.

## 7. Extensibility

- **Choice Reasoning:**
  - Designed the system to allow easy addition of new image adapters.
- **Benefits:**
  - Future-proofs the project against changes in image processing requirements.
  - Encourages contributions and scalability.
